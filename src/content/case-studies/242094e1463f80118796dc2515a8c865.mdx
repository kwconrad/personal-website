### Overview

> My client, a well-known designer in the Greater Sacramento Region (GSR), regularly receives opportunities for creative work—often through informal channels like emails, Slack, and word of mouth.
>
> However, she lacked a system for connecting these opportunities with local creative professionals in a structured, discoverable, and equitable way.
>
> **The core UX breakdown?** Local talent was disconnected from local work due to _fragmented channels, lack of visibility, and no centralized hub_.

## Goals

### **Design goals**

Understand how creative professionals in the GSR (Greater Sacramento Region):

- Discover meaningful, skill-aligned local work.
- Display social proof to build trust and grow their network.
- Showcase their value authentically.

### **Business goals**

To create a solution that:

- Amplifies local opportunities.
- Positions the client as a creative connector and thought leader.
- Becomes a scalable asset for community impact.

---

## Discovery & Initial Assumptions

**In early discussions, the client highlighted:**

- She has been receiving a steady flow of job requests for creative roles.
- Frustration with _informal, disorganized_ job sharing.
- A desire to serve her community with a curated, purpose-built platform.

**I initially assumed:**

- We might build a **custom responsive web app**.
- We might need some kind of a **search bar**, a way to view job listings, and potentially user profiles.
- There might be **accounts with tiered visibility**.
- We might want to emphasize **social proof** (referrals, testimonials, local credibility).

## Research

### Demographic Survey

I launched a survey targeting local creatives to understand:

- How they currently find jobs.
- The platforms they use.
- How they present their portfolios.
- What makes job-seeking difficult for them.

[See survey results here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NWNlTFPuSDGK0SLEUVlSL3WJGBiKJB7-qjMYaEoJ8Bk/edit?usp=sharing)

### User Interviews

Follow-up interviews revealed consistent patterns:

- **Volume strategy**: Many creatives apply everywhere and hope that something lands and they get hired.
- **Network dependency**: Word-of-mouth and referrals are often the _only_ effective path.
- **Social proof matters**: Previous clients, referrals, and endorsements **play a key role** in landing work.

> “Word of mouth is huge, through connections I've had my last two jobs.”

### **Key Insight: Social Proof Wins**

The most common thread I saw within all of my initial research was the need for social proof. Having connections and experiences that justify your candidacy for a position, and being able to display that as a potential candidate.

So I decided to focus on how to make:

- Jobs feel **credible**.
- Candidates feel **legitimate**.
- The **social fabric of the creative community** is honored and surfaced.

---

### Follow up steps

Next steps I would take here, if I had time:

- Explore and validate my understanding of social proof in this context
- Create a usable prototype that I could share with users to gather more insights and validate my assumptions
- Survey users about the prototype they used to reveal deeper insights
- Redefine the problem and share findings with my team/client
