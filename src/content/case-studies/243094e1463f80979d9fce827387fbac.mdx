### Overview

> WhatsApp is a widely used messaging app, but it lacks a native feature for scheduling messages. This is a common request from users who want to send messages at a later time without needing to use third-party apps or workarounds.

**"I would like to see a schedule message feature added. This would help when I have a message to send but don't want to disturb them during a certain time or even to send myself a message at a certain time as a reminder."**
[reddit, 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/1f2k3vp/feature_request_to_schedule_a_message/)

**"So many times I want to send somebody something but its 2AM and I don't want to wake them, or you want to send something to somebody in a different time zone. How is this not a thing yet?"**
[reddit, 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/1cw21wy/theyre_always_adding_new_features_which_i_like/)

### Design Goals

The goal is to:

- Increase engagement with the app through new asynchronous communication use cases.
- Provide support for neurodivergent users with memory issues (scheduled before forgetting)
- Boost user retention for WhatsApp business by providing timed outreach to customers,
- Support cross-timezone communication

### Technical considerations

**Local vs. cloud storage:**

- **Local storage** seems to intuitively be more private, as the data stays on the users device. However, it seems likely that this data could be erased if a user uninstalls and re-installs the app for example, leading to lost messages. That is a big enough issue to explore in this technical comparison
- **Cloud storage** would be great because it would free up space on the users device, but the technical lift to encrypt and store scheduled messages in the cloud may be high.

**Encryption Considerations:**

- **Trust is key:** Any cloud storage must avoid plaintext messages and be fully end-to-end encrypted, to align with WhatsApps current model.
- **Privacy:** end-to-end encryption techniques must be robust and flexible.
- **Separation of concerns:** This feature should probably be separate from the core messaging and encryption system

### **Deliverables**

- **UI Mockups** in Figma:
  - Press-and-hold send button reveals "Schedule Message".
  - Modal picker for date/time selection.
  - Scheduled messages shown with a clock icon and edit/delete options in attachments panel.
- **Prototypes**:
  - Interactive flows for testing usability.
  - Edge case handling: message editing, rescheduling, or device being offline.

### Prototype

I wrote a prototype that demonstrates the core functionality of the scheduled messaging feature. The prototype includes:

- A message input field with a long-pressable send button.
- A popover for selecting time to send the scheduled message.
- A way to view scheduled messages with options to edit or delete them.
