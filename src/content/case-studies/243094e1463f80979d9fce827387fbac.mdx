### Overview

> Despite WhatsAppâ€™s nearly ubiquitous presence as a messaging platform, it currently lacks native support for scheduled messaging, a feature that has been requested by users who want to send messages at a future time. This case study explores both the design and development of a **native, end-to-end encrypted scheduled messaging feature** within WhatsApp.

### Design Goals

The goal is to:

- Increase engagement with the app through new asynchronous communication use cases.
- Provide support for neurodivergent users with memory issues (scheduled before forgetting)
- Boost user retention for WhatsApp business by providing timed outreach to customers,
- Support cross-timezone communication

### Technical considerations

**Local vs. cloud storage:**

- **Local storage** seems to intuitively be more private, as the data stays on the users device. However, it seems likely that this data could be erased if a user uninstalls and re-installs the app for example, leading to lost messages. That is a big enough issue to explore in this technical comparison
- **Cloud storage** would be great because it would free up space on the users device, but the technical lift to encrypt and store scheduled messages in the cloud may be high.

**Encryption Considerations:**

- **Trust is key:** Any cloud storage must avoid plaintext messages and be fully end-to-end encrypted, to align with WhatsApps current model.
- **Privacy:** end-to-end encryption techniques must be robust and flexible.
- **Separation of concerns:** This feature should probably be separate from the core messaging and encryption system

### **Deliverables**

- **UI Mockups** in Figma:
  - Press-and-hold send button reveals "Schedule Message".
  - Modal picker for date/time selection.
  - Scheduled messages shown with a clock icon and edit/delete options in attachments panel.
- **Prototypes**:
  - Interactive flows for testing usability.
  - Edge case handling: message editing, rescheduling, or device being offline.

### Research in progress

This case study is still not finished. More to come, stay tuned!
